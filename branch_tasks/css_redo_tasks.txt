# Context

We have developed our website and applied CCS to it. However when the window is resized a lot of the formatting becomes disjointed with a reduced user experience. 

# Story

As a FS Developer I want the css of the websites main pages to be refactured to ensure that a high quality user experience is maintained for windows of different dimmensions. 

# Acceptance criteria

No text falls outside of its boundary box when window resized. 

Layout of page is visually appealing when window resized in variety of ways

No overlapping elements when window resized.
